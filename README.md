# About 'Challenge-303'
'Challenge-303' is a personal project of 303 different mini projects. Originally in Java but you can feel free to rewrite to any language as you want.

## Structure
* Each topic is in a separate folder. The folder number corresponds to the topic nubmer. For example: 
```
The folder named '3' contains a theme project with the number '3'.
```
* Folder with number of project contain a package with challenge name. For example:
```
Folder named '3' contains a package named Challenge3
```
* Each package contains files for one exercise. 

## Challenge-303 list:

  - 000 - Calculate area of rectangle - User can enter a values from keyboard.
  - 001 - Mod division of two values- User can enter a values from keyboard.
  - 002 - A+B - Sum of two integers. Example input: 5 5 Output: 10.
  - 003 - "Guess the number" - Generate numbers from 0 to 100.
  - 004 - Using for loop, while and do while calculate y = 9x for 10 values starting from 0.
  - 005 - Using for loop, while and do while - print numbers from 0 to 50. In while loop put sum of numbers from this loop.
  - 006 - Generate 5 random values. Print minimum and maximum value. Calculate sum of generated numbers.
  - 007 - Multiplication table in the range of 10,000 (100x100).
  - 008 - Create array with 10 elements. Put value 9 for array index 0. Value 8 for index 1, value 7 for index 2 etc.
  - 009 - Create two dimmension array - 10x10. For [0][0] the value is 1. For [1][1] the value is 1. For [2][2] the value is 1 etc.
  - 010 - Two dimension array - print the diagonally numbers from 0 to 10. For [0][0] the value is 1. For [1][2] the value is 2 etc.
  - 011 - [X]
  - 012 - Multiplication table with two for loops.
  - 013 - Multiplication Table with do while loop.
